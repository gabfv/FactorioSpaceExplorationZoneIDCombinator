# FactorioSpaceExplorationCMEcombinator
Factorio mod for Space Exploration that adds a special combinator that shows the current zone ID as a signal with its correct zone type (asteroid fields, planets, orbits, etc)

### Caveats
Don't use this on a spaceship, it won't get updated when the ship travels somewhere. Use the spaceship console's output instead to get the current zone.

### UPS
I think the UPS cost of this mod is very minimal since a script is only executed when the combinator is placed.
